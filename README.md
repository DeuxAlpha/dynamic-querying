## Getting Started 
The provided code includes C# classes for dynamic querying within a .NET application. The code includes various features such as filtering, sorting, pagination, and aggregation. It's important to note that the code is designed to be used within a larger .NET application, so it may not be suitable for smaller applications.

## Examples 
The code is well-structured and the methods are easy to follow. The BaseExpressions class includes methods for getting a property from a class and converting a value to the expected type. The FilterExpressions class includes methods for filtering and sorting data. The QueryRequest class includes properties for filtering, sorting, pagination, and aggregation, and will be the main utility passed to the QueryService class.

Here's an example of how you can use the code to perform a query:

```csharp
using(var context = new DatabaseContext())
{
    var query = context.Users;

    var request = new QueryRequest
    {
        Filters = new List<Filter>
        {
            new Filter
            {
                PropertyName = "Email",
                ComparisonEnum = ComparisonEnum.Contains,
                Value = "gmail.com"
            }
        }
    };

    var response = QueryService.GetQueryResponse(query, request);

    foreach (var result in response.Items)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```
## Additional Notes 
One thing to note is that the code uses IQueryable, which may not be performant when used with larger datasets. It's important to keep this in mind and test the code with larger datasets to ensure acceptable performance.

## Disclaimers 
This code is provided as-is, and there are no guarantees that it will work with your specific application or use case. Additionally, any modifications to the code will be the responsibility of the user. It's important to thoroughly test the code before using it in a production environment.
